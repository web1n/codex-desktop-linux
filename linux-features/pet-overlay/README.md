# Pet Overlay

This optional Linux feature makes the Codex avatar window behave more like a
desktop pet overlay on compositors that support the required window hints. It
is disabled by default and lives entirely under `linux-features/`.

It does not install a custom pet, change the default pet, modify the pet
selector, or patch an already built `app.asar`. It only patches the avatar
overlay window behavior during the normal install or package build pipeline.

Enable it by copying `linux-features/features.example.json` to
`linux-features/features.json` and listing the feature id:

```json
{
  "enabled": [
    "pet-overlay"
  ]
}
```

Feature settings can be overridden in the gitignored `features.json` file:

```json
{
  "enabled": [
    "pet-overlay"
  ],
  "settings": {
    "pet-overlay": {
      "petOverlay": {
        "gravity": "bottom-right",
        "margin": 24,
        "allWorkspaces": true,
        "alwaysOnTop": true,
        "skipTaskbar": true,
        "lockPosition": false,
        "mode": "interactive",
        "hyprland": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`lockPosition: false` preserves manual pet moves when the existing window
position is visible. Set it to `true` only when you want the mascot pinned to
the configured screen corner on every layout pass.

## Options

| Key | Values | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gravity` | `bottom-right`, `bottom-left`, `top-right`, `top-left` | `bottom-right` | Screen corner used when `lockPosition` is enabled. |
| `margin` | `0` to `512` | `24` | Pixel gap from the selected screen edges. |
| `allWorkspaces` | `true` or `false` | `true` | Calls Electron `setVisibleOnAllWorkspaces` where supported. |
| `alwaysOnTop` | `true` or `false` | `true` | Calls Electron `setAlwaysOnTop`. |
| `skipTaskbar` | `true` or `false` | `true` | Keeps the pet out of task switchers where supported. |
| `lockPosition` | `true` or `false` | `false` | Pins to `gravity` when true; otherwise keeps a visible manual position. |
| `mode` | `interactive` or `passive` | `interactive` | `passive` makes the pet window non-focusable. |
| `hyprland` | `true` or `false` | `true` | Uses `hyprctl` only in detected Hyprland sessions. |

Runtime overrides are also supported after restart:

```bash
CODEX_PET_OVERLAY_MARGIN=16
CODEX_PET_OVERLAY_GRAVITY=bottom-left
CODEX_PET_OVERLAY_MODE=passive
CODEX_PET_OVERLAY_LOCK_POSITION=1
CODEX_PET_OVERLAY_HYPRLAND=0
```

The feature keeps GPU compositing enabled by default so the transparent overlay
can render correctly. An explicit user value takes precedence: launching with
`CODEX_ELECTRON_DISABLE_GPU_COMPOSITING=1` still enables the documented Wayland
stability workaround if the main window flickers or leaves stale frame trails.

The legacy `CODEX_PET_LINUX_*` names from the prototype are still accepted for
local compatibility.

## Hyprland Notes

When `hyprland` is enabled, the feature reads `hyprctl clients -j`, selects
only an unambiguous floating window with the exact `Codex Pet Overlay` title,
the current process ID, and matching geometry, then applies targeted
compositor actions to the matched `address:0x...` selector. When position
locking is enabled, it also uses Hyprland's native window movement dispatch so
the computed position is respected on Wayland.

Workspace pinning and top-order changes follow `allWorkspaces` and
`alwaysOnTop`; disabling either setting actively removes the corresponding
Electron hint and stops issuing that Hyprland action.

Hyprland command failures are ignored so launching Codex does not depend on
`hyprctl` being present.

## Testing

Run the feature unit tests from the repository root:

```bash
node --test linux-features/pet-overlay/test.js
```

For a manual check, enable the feature, rebuild, and launch the app:

- The pet overlay should remain transparent.
- Selecting a different pet should update the open overlay without restarting Codex.
- On Hyprland, the pet should have no visible compositor border or shadow.
- The pet should remain above normal windows and visible across workspaces where
  the compositor honors those hints.
- With `lockPosition: false`, dragging the pet should not snap it back on the
  next click, tab switch, or overlay layout update.
- With `lockPosition: true`, the mascot should stay at the configured corner.

## Known Risks

Wayland compositors may reject app-driven positioning, all-workspace visibility,
or z-order changes. Hyprland support is best-effort and deliberately scoped to a
single unambiguous matched avatar window.
